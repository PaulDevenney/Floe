Reverse-Floe
============

Floe IRC Client based on the original (amazing) work by bretternst.

I Plan to include minor changes to allow better notification to a user who minimises their Floe window.

* When minimised ballon popup for all chat messages, not just private channel messages
* Indicator on the icon that you missed messages
* (Hopefully) settings to allow these to be switched on/off
* Replace the old Notify Icon component to allow for more control (clicking on the ballon etc)
